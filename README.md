Nik.Ai

Nik.Ai is a modular-monolithic AI platform designed for simplicity, extensibility, and performance.
It provides a unified foundation where diverse modules—such as a portfolio site, chatbot engine, LLM tools, simulators, and more—can operate seamlessly within a single scalable architecture.

🔧 Key Features

Modular Monolithic Design
Add, remove, or extend modules without breaking the core system. Each module is isolated yet works cohesively within the main application.

AI-Ready Architecture
Integrates chatbots, LLM pipelines, and simulation environments with minimal setup.

Scalable by Design
Grow the project organically by adding new modules as needed—no microservice complexity required.

Flexible Use Cases
Build interactive portfolios, AI assistants, data simulators, and custom tools all under one framework.
